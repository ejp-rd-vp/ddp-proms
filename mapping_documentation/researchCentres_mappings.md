# Research Centres Mappings

Mappings for the data contained within the "hospital" and "otherHospital" fields from the "general", "specificVisit", "emergencies" and "hospitalization" visits from the medical care data

## CSV file

### CSV file

Please find the CSV file [here](../term_mappings/researchCentres_mappings.csv)

### Columns

databaseName,centerURI,centerPrefName

## Notes:

- databaseName - the **EXACT** contents of the "hospital" field in the database, unless it is "Other", then it should be the contents of the "otherHospital" field
- centerURI - matching URI ([ROR](https://ror.org/) preferred) for the hospital name from the database
- centerPrefName - preferred name for the hospital as stated in the ontology where its URI was extracted from

## Comments:

- The database contained "Bravis Ziekenhuis Bergen op Zoom", interpreted as the visit happening at Bravis Ziekenhuis (Bergen), but happening via Zoom instead of in-person, so we used [Bravis Ziekenhuis](https://ror.org/05564wx43)
